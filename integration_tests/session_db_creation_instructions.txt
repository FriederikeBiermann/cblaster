Test function calling:
Best way is to use the command line with 'pytest -s integration_tests.py' you can provide an extra -k argument with text
 to filter the tests on. So if for instance you want to only run the local_search tests simply add -k local_search

Integration tests file preparation:
- database creation: cblaster makedb database_creation_file.embl database_creation_file.gb -n test_database_windows -->
  based on the operating system the db is made for add windows, linux or darwin respectively. The files for creation of
  the database can be found in the folder integration_tests/database_creation_files
- local session creation: the embl and genbank session files are the session files resulting from running the first and
  second local_search tests
- remote session is created by taking the test_query.fa and submitting that to NCBI webserver to get an RID. Then the
  session file is created using all the standard settings (settings are tested during recompute) and the RID as input.
  The main reason is that NCBI from within cblaster is really slow (~1 hour regardless of query)
